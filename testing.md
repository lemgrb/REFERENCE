## 1. Fundamentals of Testing
### 1-2 Why is Testing Necessary?
- QA vs Testing
- Errors occur due to:
  - Human fallibility
  - Lack of experience
  - Misunderstanding of inter-system and intra-system interation
  - Environment conditions (for IOT) e.g. radiation, electromagnetic
- Error (lead to) --> Defect (lead to) --> Failure
<dl>
  <dt>Failure</dt>
  <dd>when code is executed, defect manifest as failure</dd>
</dl>
- **Root cause of defects** - earliest actions or conditions that contributed to creating the defects

### Seven (7) Testing Principles
1. Testing shows presence of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
3. Early testing (shift-left) saves time and money
4. Defect cluster together
5. Beware of the Pesticide Paradox
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-error-fallacy

### 1-4 The test process
- Commons set of test activities (test process)
- Test Strategy:
  1. Which test activities
  2. How test process is implemented
  3. When process and activities occur
- Test Process in Context influenced by:
  - SDLC and project methodologies
  - Test levels and test types
  - ....
- Test Activities and Tasks
  1. Test Planning - Define test objectives, approach for meeting objectives
  2. Test Monitoring and Control
  3. Test Analysis
  4. Test Design
  5. Test Implementation
  6. Test Execution
    - Test suites run accdg. to test schedule
    - Report defects
  7. Test Completion
- Test Work Producs (See above)
  1. System Integration Test Plan, UAT Plan, Performance Test Plan
  2. Test Progress Reports, Test Summary Report (Audience relevant)
  3. Defined and prioritized test conditions w/ traceability
    - Test charters for Exploratory
  4. Test cases and set of test cases to
  5. Test suites, Test Execution Schedule
  6. Defect logs
  7. Test summary reports
- Psychology
  - Developer confirmation bias makes it difficult to find mistakes in their own work
  - Developer tendency to blame the bearer of bad news (testers)
  - Independent testers brings
